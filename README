tinyAOP is a tiny proxy based AOP framework, written to demonstrate the concepts of AOP. It was featured in my NDC 2010 talk about AOP.

For usage demo, see TinyAop.Tests/Demo_scenarios/

It's a very bare bones framework, written for educational purposes. So use this in production code at your own risk :-p
